    "Name": "Turkish Lamb Chops With Sumac, Tahini, and Dill",
    "Description": "Given my very high regard for a grilled naked lamb chop, all juicy and charred, when I do go for something more elaborate, it's got to be worth it. This dish is. Here, the meat is coated in toasted whole spices\u2014fennel, coriander, and cumin seeds\u2014that have been very lightly crushed. The seeds retain their texture, giving the meat both a heady scent and a good crunch. For serving, a tahini-lemon sauce adds a rich nuttiness, while a dash of sumac provides its berrylike tartness.",

    "Description": "I met Suzy in 1999, when I moved to New York after college and she had just relocated from Portland, Oregon. We ended up as roommates in Brooklyn, and it was in that apartment in Fort Greene that we discovered the joys of cooking together on Sundays. Suzy's mom, Sally, passed this recipe down to her and, in turn, Suzy taught it to me. We still make it together to this day, nearly twenty years later.",
