It really is a fine example of the miracles of infusion. The dried c\u00e8pe (porcini) mushroom powder packs a maximum of fragrance and flavor and takes well to many variations: Pair it with paper-thin slices of raw domestic mushrooms or seared domestic or wild mushrooms showered in the bowl at serving time; prepare with dried morel powder in place of c\u00e8pes; top with thin slices of raw black truffles; or add a dollop of mushroom-powder- infused whipped cream.",

Here, the meat is coated in toasted whole spices\u2014fennel, coriander, and cumin seeds\u2014that have been very lightly crushed. The seeds retain their texture, giving the meat both a heady scent and a good crunch. For serving, a tahini-lemon sauce adds a rich nuttiness, while a dash of sumac provides its berrylike tartness.",
