On the streets of Lisbon and outside any nightclub or bar in Johannesburg, you\u2019ll find vendors grilling steak and slathering garlic butter on a soft bun\u2014heaven. The key to this mouth-watering street food is finding a soft, airy roll to absorb the steak juices. If there is a Portuguese market near you, you\u2019re in luck! If not, look for a soft roll dusted with flour at your local bakery.",
